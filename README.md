# Timestamp Changer
Ever find yourself in need of changing the date and time on a file?  This should be easy right?  Right.

Unfortunately, it’s not quite as easy as you may expect.  Changing your system’s time and date has undesirable side effects and obstacles such as time services also exist.  Online searches aren’t any better at rendering simple solutions, often requiring some amount of code.  Too bad this functionality isn’t built right into the file property dialog.

That’s where this app comes in.  Just run it, point to your file, change the time and date, and click the button to save changes.
